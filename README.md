**Key Features:**

**Real-Time Object Detection:** The system uses the SSD MobileNet algorithm to identify objects instantly, offering immediate feedback to the user.

**Distance Estimation:** It calculates the approximate distance between the user and detected objects, providing crucial spatial information.

**Voice-Based Feedback:** Based on the distance calculations, the system delivers voice-based feedback, informing the user if an object is too close or at a safer distance. This feature enhances navigation by helping users avoid obstacles and move more safely through their environment
